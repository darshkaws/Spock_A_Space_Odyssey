Since I haven't figured out how to clone and use Git yet, and I have some of my own ideas for the game's backstory, I've created a new file. I hope everyone can understand.






Game Title: "Dreams of the Cosmos"

Background Setting:
Before the birth of the universe, an indescribable cosmic entity known as "Azathoth" existed at the edge of the cosmos. It is believed that His slumber gave rise to all things, including the powerful ancient deities and omnipotent outer gods. He is a source of both awe and dread, for His awakening could lead to the obliteration of the universe as we know it. To prevent this cataclysm, Azathoth was confined within a celestial body referred to as "Earth." The denizens of Earth, through their epic narratives and harmonious compositions, have the power to lull Him back to a peaceful slumber.

Geographical Divisions:
Over time, Earth has fractured into nine distinct regions, each named as follows:

Northern Land: Azelas
Northeastern Realm: Zygar
Eastern Enclave: The Garden
Southeastern Territory: Eclipsis
Southern Domain: CLion
Southwestern Dominion: Gortrov
Western Expanse: Fffire
Northwestern Province: Vulcan
Central Hub: Courtyard
These regions, however, were not scattered into the deep cosmos due to the influence of the outer gods. Instead, they coalesced into a colossal spherical shell, effectively cocooning Azathoth and thwarting His reawakening.

Mission: The Interpretation
In their quest to prevent Azathoth's resurgence, the denizens of Earth have constructed nine grandiose stages within these nine realms. Their mission is to interpret nine epic tales that would appease Azathoth's dreams and keep Him in peaceful slumber. These nine epics include:

Hero vs. Dark Lord: Drawing inspiration from Homer's "The Iliad," where Achilles stands as the hero and Hector as the dark lord, the story centers around their titanic conflict.

Dragon Slayer: Rooted in Norse mythology's "Beowulf," this narrative tells of the hero Sigurd's battle against the dragon Fafnir, ultimately leading to the beast's demise.

Prince and Princess: Based on Greek mythology's "Persephone," this story narrates the love tale between Prince Perseus and the enchanting Princess Andromeda, who presents him with challenging tasks to win her heart.

Aladdin and the Magic Lamp: Drawing from "One Thousand and One Nights," it depicts the rags-to-riches story of Aladdin, who, through the power of a magic lamp, marries the king's daughter and becomes a prince.

Prince vs. Demon: Adapted from the Indian epic "Ramayana," this story illustrates Prince Rama's decisive battle against the demon king Ravana to save his beloved Sita.

The Hero's Return: Inspired by Greek mythology's "The Odyssey," it follows the adventures of the hero Odysseus, culminating in his triumphant return to his homeland of Ithaca, where his faithful Penelope awaits.

Warrior vs. Demon: Drawing from the Samharam epic, it chronicles the prolonged conflict between the warrior Sindbad and the demon Gabaar, an integral part of Indian mythology.

White Snake's Tale: Inspired by the Chinese traditional myth of "Legend of the White Snake," it narrates the love between the White Snake spirit, Bai Suzhen, and the ordinary man, Xu Xian, featuring elements of romance, adventure, and magical battles.

Love and Miracles: Based on Egyptian mythology's "Isis and Osiris," it tells the love story of Prince Osiris and Princess Isis, and their struggle against malevolent forces.

The Conclusion:
Congratulations to you and the inhabitants of Earth for successfully interpreting these nine epics, preventing the resurgence of Azathoth, and restoring Earth to its former state. Recognizing the paramount importance of these epic narratives, the outer gods have decided to return Earth to a medieval era and have sealed off the potential for technological development, ensuring that Earth continues to perform and sustains Azathoth's peaceful slumber.





I personally believe that the background story I've created may potentially add to the workload for everyone. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know, and I will be ready to make revisions or cut down on certain aspects, especially within the mainland, where I believe retaining 2-4 elements might be more suitable.
